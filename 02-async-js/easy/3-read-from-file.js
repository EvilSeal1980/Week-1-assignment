// ## Reading the contents of a file

// Write code to read contents of a file and print it to the console. 
// You can use the fs library to as a black box, the goal is to understand async tasks. 
// Try to do an expensive operation below the file read and see how it affects the output. 
// Make the expensive operation more and more expensive and see how it affects the output. 

const fs = require('fs');

    return;
  }

  console.log('File contents:', data);
